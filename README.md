# EDGE DRIVERS BETA CREATED OR MODIFIED BY Mariano Colmenarejo

# WARNING:The Lua code for the drivers in this repository has has updated sep 2025 to last version of my drivers in my shared channel.

# The code is valid as a reference or as an help for modifying or creating new drivers. Drivers generated directly with this code may display errors when packaging the driver or may not work correctly and require several modifications.

# The packaged drivers, shared, and available on my Edge drivers Shared Channel, work perfectly with the smartthings hub firmware 57.14, although they no longer implement some non-essential features of firmware 56.x and 57.x.

- Some Drivers created with default libraries smartthings edge and added fingerprint of devices
- Some Drivers created with default libraries smartthings edge and added custom code funtions or custom profilesCancel changes
- Some Drivers Modified from original smartthings driver with adding fingerprints or profiles of new devices
- All Drivers tested with my devices or tested by others users

This repository and the shared channel to download the drivers has grown much more than I would have imagined at the beginning of Edge Drivers.

I feel very grateful for all the thanks received from users and many of you have asked me how to make a donation or gift to thank and help maintain the channel. 
I didn't plan on doing it, but if someone voluntarily wants to do it this is my paypal link

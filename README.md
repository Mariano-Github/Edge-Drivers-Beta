This repository and the shared channel to download the drivers has grown much more than I would have imagined at the beginning of Edge Drivers.

I feel very grateful for all the thanks received from users and many of you have asked me how to make a donation or gift to thank and help maintain the channel. 
I didn't plan on doing it, but if someone voluntarily wants to do it this is my paypal link
